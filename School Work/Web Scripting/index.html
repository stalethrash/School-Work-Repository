		Hello!  I am a software development student at Bellevue University. <br />
		I have done a miriad of things in my life from traveling as a musician, <br />
		working as a chef, selling comic books to people near and far, dispatching <br />
		medical helicopters to the desperate and dying, and now I find myself learning <br />
		the ropes as a financial representative for a brokerage firm.  I'm hoping to <br />
		use my education to help me get into the IT department with my new employer, so <br />
		wish me luck!
	<p /> <br />

	<p>
		I love all sorts of movies, but I have a preference for action flicks.  My favorite would <br />
		have to be Top Gun.  I also play guitar and I am a big fan of guitar centric music, <br />
		especially metal music.
    </p> <br />
